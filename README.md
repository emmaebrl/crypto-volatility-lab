# ðŸŒŸ Cryptocurrency Volatility Prediction and Portfolio Strategy ðŸ“ˆ
Welcome on our project "crypto-volatility-lab" based on the paper "Volatility Forecasting with Neural Networks
for Portfolio Optimization of
cryptocurrencies indexes" that can be found in this repo.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals and Outcomes
- Build an **end-to-end cryptocurrency analysis pipeline**.
- Leverage **AI and neural networks** to predict market behavior.
- Construct and compare **portfolio allocation strategies** to maximize returns and manage risk effectively.

All components will be designed using a **modular, package-oriented approach** in Python.

To use objects developed in `crypto_volatility_lab`, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
## ðŸš€ Running the API
Once the setup is complete, you can start the FastAPI server.

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
